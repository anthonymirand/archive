learning to not envy
someone else's blessings
is what grace looks like.

love will come
and when love comes
love will hold you
love will call your name
and you will melt
sometimes though
love will hurt you but
love will never mean to
love will play no games
cause love knows life
has been hard enough already.

the universe took its time on you
crafted you precisely
so you could offer the world
something distinct from everyone else
so when you doubt
how you were created
you doubt an energy greater than us both.

what's it to me
if you love me or
miss me or need me
when you are doing
nothing to be with me
if you can't allow me to be
the love of your life i will be
the loss of your life instead.

your name is
the strongest
positive and negative
connotation in any language
it lights me up or
leaves me aching for days.

they leave
and act like it never happened
they come back
and act like they never left.

you tell me to quiet down cause
my opinions make me less beautiful
but i was not made with a fire in my belly
so i could be put out
i was not made with a lightness in my tongue
so i could be easy to swallow
i was made heavy
half blade and half silk
difficult to forget but
not easy for the mind to follow.

he placed his hands
on my mind
before reaching
for my waist
my hips
or my lips
he didn't call me
beautiful first
he called me
exquisite.

i do not want to have you
to fill the empty parts of me
i want to be full on my own
i want to be so complete
i could light a whole city
and then
i want to have you
cause the two of us combined
could set it on fire.

i am a museum full of art
but you had your eyes shut.

i want to apologize to all the women
i have called pretty.
before i've called them intelligent or brave.
i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you're born with
is the most you have to be proud of
when your spirit has crushed mountains
from now on i will say things like, you are resilient
or, you are extraordinary.
not because i don't think you're pretty.
but because you are so much more than that.

how is it so easy for you
to be kind to people he asked
milk and honey dripped
from my lips as i answered
cause people have not
been kind to me.

i am water
soft enough
to offer life
tough enough
to drown it away.

if i knew what
safety looked like
i would have spent
less time falling into
arms that were not.

it was when i stopped searching for home within others
and lifted the foundations of home within myself
i found there were no roots more intimate
than those between a mind and body
that have decided to be whole.

i always
get myself
into this mess
i always let him
tell me i am beautiful
and half believe it
i always jump thinking
he will catch me
at the fall
i am hopelessly
a lover and
a dreamer and
that will be the
death of me.

what's the greatest lesson a woman should learn?
that since day one. she's already had everything
she needs within herself. it's the world that
convinced her she did not.

i don't know what living a balanced life feels like
when i am sad
i don't cry i pour
when i am happy
i don't smile i glow
when i am angry
i don't yell i burn
the good thing about feeling in extremes is
when i love i give them wings
but perhaps that isn't
such a good thing cause
they always tend to leave
and you should see me
when my heart is broken
i don't grieve
i shatter.

you treat them as if
they have a heart like yours
but not everyone can be as soft and as tender as you
you don't see
the person they are
you see the person
they have the potential to be
you give and give till
they have taken everything
out of you and leave
you empty.

he isn't coming back
whispered my head
he has to
sobbed my heart.

the world
gives you
so much pain
and here you are
making gold out of it.

perhaps i don't deserve
nice things cause i am
paying for sins i don't
remember.

you tell me
i am not like most girls
and learn to kiss me with your eyes closed
something about the phrase -- something about
how i have to be unlike the women
i call sisters in order to be wanted
makes me want to spit your tongue out
like i am supposed to be proud you picked me
as if i should be relieved you think
i'm better than them.

i do not want to have you
to fill the empty parts of me
i want to be full on my own
i want to be so complete
i could light a whole city
and then
i want to have you
cause the two of
us combined
could set it
on fire.

other women's bodies
are not our battlegrounds.

trying to convince myself
i am allowed
to take up space
is like writing with
my left hand
when i was born
to use my right.

if you are broken
and they have left you
do not question
whether you were
enough
the problem was
you were so enough
they were not able to carry it.

the next time he points out
the hair on your legs is growing back
remind that boy
your body is not his home
he is a guest
warn him to never
outstep his welcome
again.

we all move forward when
we recognize how resilient
and striking the women
around us are.

many tried
but failed to catch me
i am the ghost of ghosts
everywhere and nowhere
i am magic tricks
within magic within magic
none have figured out
i am a world wrapped in worlds
folded in suns and moons
you can try but
you won't get those hands on me.

i stand
on the sacrifices
of a million women before me
thinking
what can i do
to make this mountain taller
so the women after me
can see farther.

apparently it is ungraceful of me
to mention my period in public
cause the actual biology
of my body is too real
it is okay to sell what's between a woman's legs
more than it is okay to
mention its inner workings
the recreational use of
this body is seen as
beautiful while
its nature is
seen as ugly.

you
have been
taught your legs
are a pit stop for men
that need a place to rest
a vacant body empty enough
for guests but no one
ever comes and is
willing to
stay.

and here you are living
despite it all.

i think my body knew you would not stay.

how it is so easy for you
to be kind to people he asked
milk and honey dripped
from my lips as i answered
cause people have not
been kind to me

the first boy that kissed me
held my shoulders down
like the handlebars of
the first bicycle
he ever rode
i was five
he had the smell of
starvation on his lips
which he picked up from
his father feasting on his mother at 4 a.m.
he was the first boy
to teach me my body was
for giving to those that wanted
that i should feel anything
less than whole
and my god
did i feel as empty
as his mother at 4:25 a.m.

you
have been
taught your legs
are a pit stop for men
that need a place to rest
a vacant body empty enough
for guests but no one
ever comes and is
willing to
stay

it is your blood
in my veins
tell me how i'm
supposed to forget

the therapist places
the doll in front of you
it is the size of girls
your uncles like touching
point to where his hands were
you point to the spot
between its legs the one
he fingered out of you
like a confession
how're you feeling
you pull the lump
in your throat out
with your teeth
and say fine
numb really

he was supposed to be
the first male love of your life
you still search for him
everywhere
- father

you were so afraid
of my voice
i decided to be
afraid of it too

she was a rose
in the hands of those
who had no intention
of keeping her

every time you
tell your daughter
you yell at her
out of love
you tech her to confuse
anger with kindness
which seems like a good idea
till she grows up to
trust men who hurt her
cause they look so much
like you
- to fathers with daughters

i've had sex she said
but i don't know
what making love
feels like

if i knew what
safety looked like
i would have spent
less time falling into
arms that were not

sex takes the consent of two
if one person is lying there not doing anything
cause they are not ready
or not in the mood
or simply don't want to
yet the other is having sex
with their body it's not love
it is rape

the idea that we are
so capable of love
but still choose
to be toxic

there is no bigger illusion in the world
than the idea that a woman will
bring dishonor into a home
if she tries to keep her heart
and her body safe

you pinned
my legs to
the ground
with your feet
and demanded
i stand up

the rape will
tear you
in half
but it
will not
end you

you have sadness living in places
sadness shouldn't live

a daughter should
not have to
beg her father
for a relationship

trying to convince myself
i am allowed
to take up space
is like writing with
my left hand
when i was born
to use my right
- the idea of shrinking is hereditary

he gut her
with his fingers
like he's scraping
the inside of a
cantaloupe clean

your mother
is in the habit of
offering more love
than you can carry
your father is absent
you are a war
the border between two countries
the collateral damage
the paradox that joins the two
but also splits them apart

emptying out of my mother's belly
was my first act of disappearance
learning to shrink for a family
who likes their daughters invisible
was the second
the art of being empty
is simple
believe them when they say
you are nothing
repeat it to yourself
like a wish
i am nothing
i am nothing
i am nothing
so often
the only reason you know
you're still alive is from the
heaving of your chest
- the art of being empty

you look just like your mother
i guess i do carry her tenderness well
you both have the same eyes
cause we are both exhausted
and the hands
we share the same wilting fingers
but that rage your mother doesn't war that anger
you're right
this rage is the one thing
i get from my father

when my mother opens her mouth
to have a conversation at dinner
my father shoves the word hush
between her lips and tells her to
never speak with her mouth full
this is how the women in my family
learning to live with their mouths closed

our knees
pried open
by cousins
and uncles
and men
our bodies touched
by all the wrong people
that even in a bed full of safety
we are afraid

father. you always call to say nothing in particular.
you ask what i'm doing or where i am and when the silence stretches like a lifetime between us i scramble to find questions to keep the conversation going.
what i long to say most is.
i understand this world broke you.
it has been so hard on your feet.
i don't blame you for not knowing how to remain soft with me.
sometimes i stay up thinking of all the places you are hurting which you'll never care to mention.
i come from the same aching blood.
from the same bone so desperate for attention i collapse in on myself.
i am your daughter.
i know the small talks is the only way you know how to tell me you love me.
cause it is the only way i know how to tell you.

you plough into me with two fingers and i am mostly shocked.
it feels like rubber against an open wound.
i do not like it.
you begin pushing faster and faster.
but i feel nothing.
you search my face for a reaction so i begin acting like the naked women in the videos you watch when you think no one's looking.
i imitate their moans.
hollow and hungry.
you ask if it feels good and i say yes so quickly it sounds rehearsed.
but the acting.
you do not notice.

the thing about having
an alcoholic parent
is an alcoholic parent
does not exist
simply
an alcoholic
who could not stay sober
long enough to raise their kids

i can't tell if my mother is
terrified or in love with
my father it all
looks the same

i flinch when you touch me
i fear it is him

when my mother was pregnant
with her second child i was four
i pointed at her swollen belly confused at how
my mother had gotten so big in such little time
my father scooped me in his tree trunk arms and
said the closest thing to god on this earth
is a woman's body it's where life comes from
and to have a grown man tell me nothing
so powerful at such a young age
changed me to see the entire universe
rested at my mother's feet

i struggle so deeply
to understand
how someone can
our their entire soul
blood and energy
into someone
without wanting
anything in
return

no
it won't
be love at
first sight when
we meet it'll be love
at first remembrance cause
i've seen you in my mother's eyes
when she tells me to marry the type
of man i'd want to raise my son to be like

every revolution
starts and ends
with his lips

what am i to you he asks
i put my hands in his lap
and whisper you
are every hope
i've ever had
in human form

my favourite thing about you is your smell
you smell like
earth
herbs
gardens
a little more
human than the rest of us

i know i
should crumble
for better reasons
but have you seen
that boy he brings
the sun to its
knees every
night

you are the faint line
between faith and
blindly waiting

nothing is safer
than the sound of you
reading out loud to me

he placed his hands
on my mind
before reaching
for my waist
my hips
of my lips
he didn't call me
beautiful first
he called me
exquisite

i am learning
how to love him
by loving myself

he says
i am sorry i am not an easy person to want
i looked at him surprised
who said i wanted easy
i don't crave easy
i crave goddamn difficult

the very thought of you
has my legs spread apart
like an easel with a canvas
begging for art

i am ready for you
i have always
been
ready for you

i do not want to have you
fill the empty parts of me
i want to be full on my own
i want to be so complete
i could light a whole city
and then
i want to have you
cause the two of us combined
could set it on fire

i'd be lying if i said
you make me speechless
the truth is you make my
tongue so weak it forgets
what language to speak in

he asks me what i do
i tell him i work for a small company
that makes packaging for
he stops me mid sentence
no not what you do to pay the bills
what drives you crazy
what keeps you up at night
i tell him i write
he asks me to show him something
i take the tips of my fingers
place them inside his forearm
and graze them down his wrist
goose bumps rise to the surface
i see his mouth clench
muscles tighten
his eyes pore into mine
as though i'm the reason
for making them blink
i break gaze just as
he inches towards me
i step back
so that's what you do
you command attention
my cheeks flush as
i smile shyly

confessing
i can't help it

you might not have been my first love
but you were the love that made
all the other loves
irrelevant

you've touched me
without even
touching me

how do you turn
a forest fire like me
so soft i turn into
running water

you look like you smell of
honey and no pain
let me have a taste of that

your name is
the strongest
positive and negative
connotation in any language
it either lights me up or
leaves me aching for days

you talk too much
he whispers into my ear
i can think of better ways to use that mouth

it's youra voice that
undresses me

my name sounds so good
french kissing your tongue

you wrap your fingers
around my hair
and pull
this
is how you make
music out of me

on days
like this
i need you to
run your fingers
through my hair
and speak softly
you

i want your hands
to hold
not my hands
your lips
to kiss
not my lips
but
other places

i need someone
who knows struggle
as well as i do
someone
willing to hold my feet in their lap
on days it is too difficult to stand
the type of person who gives
exactly what i need
before i even know i need it
the type of lover who hears me
even when i do not speak
is the type of understanding
i demand

you move my hand
between my legs
and whisper
make those pretty little fingers
dance for me
